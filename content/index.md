# Hello, I'm Louis

I'm a lot of things, but one of the things that I am is a PhD candidate in philosophy.

I will be using this space to share my notes on various topics. My interests are eclectic, but I would lump them together using the term 'complex systems'. In *Theory of complex systems*, Thurner, Hanel, Klimek define a complex system as a co-evolving multilayer network of interacting entities, where interaction strength is denoted by:

$$
M_{ij}^\alpha(t)
$$

where $i,j$ are entities, $\alpha$ is their relationship. J.L. Austin famously said, "Oversimplification is the disease of philosophy." But if philosophers engage with complex systems the disease need not be terminal. Using computational methods, this powerful representational paradigm helps us analyze exquisitely complicated entities and processes from across the natural world. (Though graph theory and network theory have long been fundamental to the study of these kinds of systems, in some cases there is a tidier solution to studying them that does not require an explicit network structure.)

## Background

I began my academic career in classical philology and originally studied Greek and Roman philosophy. In 2019, I was torn about the decision to do a PhD in Philosophy given the dismal career prospects and my growing interests in AI. I decided to do a PhD in Philosophy because this program offered an opportunity to improve my mathematical and scientific skills while studying scientific questions from a philosophical point of view.

## Current Interests

Some of the topics I have recently studied are:
- Content-driven social networks
- Valuative judgment
- Mental illness

I also have a reasonably extensive background in Indo-European languages and classical philology and philosophy.

This digital garden will contain notes on these topics and others as they develop. Feel free to explore.
