Hello, I'm Louis. I'm a lot of things, but one of the things that I am is a PhD candidate in philosophy.

I will be using the space to share my notes on various topics. My interests are eclectic, but I would lump them together using the term 'complex systems'. In *Theory of complex systems*, Thurner, Hanel, Klimek define a complex system as a co-evolving multilayer network:

$$
M_{ij}^\alpha(t)
$$

where $i,j$ are entities, $\alpha$ is their relationship. Using computational simulations, this powerful representational paradigm helps us analyze exquisitely complicated entities and processes. J.L. Austin famously said, Oversimplification is the disease of philosophy. But if philosophers engage with complex systems the disease need not be terminal.

Some of the recent topics I have studied are content-driven social networks, valuative judgment, and mental illness. I also have a reasonably extensive background in Indo-European languages and classical philology and philosophy.
