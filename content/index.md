## Hello, I'm Louis

I'm a lot of things, but one of the things that I am is a PhD candidate in philosophy. I will be using this space to share my notes on various topics. For any longer form academic or nonacademic writing see my primary domain:  [louissantoro.com](louissantoro.com).

This digital garden is meant for anyone interested in philosophy, complex systems, and computation. You can browse recent notes or explore by topic. Notes here are often exploratory, reflecting ongoing research or preliminary thoughts, while longer form nonacademic writing on related topics is available on my [Substack](https://substack.com/@louissantoro).

### Background

I began my academic career in classical philology. Within philosophy I originally studied Greek and Roman philosophy, especially Plato. In 2019, I was torn about the decision to do a PhD in Philosophy. I decided to accept the admissions offer of a PhD in order to take the opportunity to study artificial intelligence, brains, and cognitive science, more generally. Acquiring this new set of skills was challenging as a philosopher, but I now have decently wide learning in cognitive science and do research wholly oriented towards computational and theoretical approaches to understanding complex phenomena.

### Research Methodologies

I primarily use computational methods, including Python-based analytical and learning frameworks, to study and solve problems over complex systems. Occasionally, I explore methods that bypass explicit network structures for simpler analytical solutions.

### Future Explorations

Topics and notes currently planned include:
- Advanced representations in transformer architectures
- Cognitive models of bounded rationality
- Geopolitical risk modeling and game-theoretic frameworks

### Selected Topics

Some of the topics I have written on throughout my PhD are:
- Content-driven social networks
- Valuative judgment
- Mechanistic explanation
- Mental illness, psychiatry, therapy

I also have a reasonably extensive background in Indo-European languages and classical philology and philosophy, which shaped my approach to philosophy and to life in ways that a first love might.
