##  Welcome to my page.

Thank you for visiting my website! I'm a lot of things, but one of the things that I am is a PhD candidate in Philosophy. This digital garden serves as a repository for my learning in computation, complex systems, and philosophy. The site is designed to be fast, text-focused, distraction free, and easy to read. Notes can be searched, browsed by recency, or explored by topic. The writing here is often a memento of a topic, an exploratory thoughts, or reflect fragments of ongoing research, while longer form nonacademic writing on related topics will be available on my [main site](https://louissantoro.com). I plan to publish notes as I study to provide myself and anyone interested a permanently accessible archive of the topics I cover along the way. I will always strive for accuracy in producing these notes. Since they are learning-oriented, they may not be expertly analyzed and will transform the content from existing articles or textbooks, which I will always credit and mention. Be sure to consult those.

### Background

I began my academic career in classical philology with a view to reading the Greek philosophers. I eventually made my way to philosophy where I studied Greek and Roman philosophy, especially Plato. I decided to accept the admissions offer of a PhD in Philosophy in order to take a different tack, namely, to use the opportunity to study artificial intelligence, brains, and cognitive science, more generally. Acquiring these skills was challenging as a philosopher, but I now have decent competency in those areas and do research wholly oriented towards computational and theoretical approaches to understanding complex phenomena. Along the way I developed an interest in computational social science as well.

### Why publish these notes
I took a long retreat from any online presence and any attempt to publish any work publicly for several years starting in 2019 or so. I noticed that academic publishing encourages a philosopher to write work that simply isn't important and that the odds of producing something *aere perennius* were almost zero in the first place. Writing in and of itself isn't very difficult. It's the thinking that counts. I thought that perhaps I should study enough that I can think and say something worth communicating. Although I have reasonably extensive notes in other forms, some of the books that I read or things that occurred to me during that period time are probably forever lost. I will never touch Greek or Roman texts and countless others with the same intensity that I did before. Some of the topics I covered in my early in my academic career I may never cover again. This archive is intended to capture what happens from here forward so that a record is maintained.

### A request

I fancy myself a creative intellectual. Anyone with any real creativity has an inexhaustible treasury of ideas, issued by fiat in the shower or on a walk to the store. It's actually overwhelming to have so many ideas, some of which are good.  Anything I share here is free. What I would really aspire to is the feeling of a friendly and advanced graduate seminar. In my own professional life I always attempt to provide others the courtesy of acknowledging my indebtedness to them, to respect their rights and contributions by attributing ideas that are not my own. These efforts are only limited by the infirmity of my own memory or by my own delusions about what could be conceived of outside of conversation with others. Given the structure of our society, representing someone else's ideas as your own is a very hostile act. I don't at all like intellectual theft; but I also don't like the idea of clamping down, charging money, making a slow and ugly website with a cookie banner and ads, and overall not fostering an environment of sharing. A philosopher often does nothing more than open up the space for us to see a problem in a new light. That kind of contribution is socially necessary but not easy to quantify. Especially for this site, I will be sharing the seeds of new ways of thinking, expressed as pointers to topics of interest, with anyone who wants to read it. If you see any value in the way that I approach these questions, I would be grateful if you did not begrudge me the satisfaction of a wink of acknowledgment (even anonymously) that my writing made some difference for you. As a physicalist and a naturalist I always try to say these things to the person before it's too late. Formally, please credit my work where appropriate, follow me on social, even better participate in the discussion. It's very hard to give everyone their Kantian due on social media, but let's be friends!

### Research methodologies

My research largely consists of the use of computational methods in order to study and solve problems over [[Complexity/philosophy_of_complexity|complex systems]]. Though 'complex systems' often denotes a network approach, I explore methods that bypass explicit network structures if doing so is useful. One of my PhD advisors in particular has instilled in me model and method selection sensitive to the structure of the problem. I would Each of the last three years has been oriented toward a different project. In order of most recent to least: a paper modeling influence maximization in content-driven social networks, a paper on a decision theoretic approach to valuative takings, and a paper arguing for a bottom up, network approach to schizophrenia.

### Future explorations

Recently, I have become interested:

- Advanced representations in transformer architectures
- Biology-based learning architectures in investigable organisms
- Geopolitical and geoeconomic modeling.

### Closing out

Thanks again for visiting my site! Note that the site was built using a customized implementation of [[https://quartz.jzhao.xyz/|Quartz 4]], whose existence greatly sped up development of the site. All the modifications I made can be found in the GitHub repository for the project. If you have any questions or want to connect, please do! I can be reached at dikaiosvne@gmail.com or you can go follow me using the social links I included in the page's header.
