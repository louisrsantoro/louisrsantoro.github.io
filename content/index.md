## Hello, I'm Louis

I'm a lot of things, but one of the things that I am is a PhD candidate in philosophy. I will be using this space to share my notes on various topics. Longer form nonacademic writing will be hosted on Substack. My interests are eclectic, but I would lump them together using the term 'complex systems'. In *Theory of complex systems*, Thurner, Hanel, Klimek define a complex system as a co-evolving multilayer network of interacting entities, where interaction strength is denoted by:

$$
M_{ij}^\alpha(t)
$$

where $i,j$ are entities, $\alpha$ is their relationship. J.L. Austin famously said, "J.L. Austin famously said, \"We must at all costs avoid oversimplification."

This digital garden is meant for anyone interested in philosophy, complex systems, and computational methods. You can browse recent notes or explore by topic. Notes here are often exploratory, reflecting ongoing research or preliminary thoughts, while longer form nonacademic writing on related topics is available on my [Substack](#).

### Background

I began my academic career in classical philology and originally studied Greek and Roman philosophy. In 2019, I was torn about the decision to do a PhD in Philosophy. Ultimately, my interests shifted towards computational and theoretical approaches to understanding complex phenomena.

### Research Methodologies

I primarily use computational methods, including Python-based analytical frameworks, to study complex systems. Occasionally, I explore methods that bypass explicit network structures for simpler analytical solutions.

### Future Explorations

Topics and notes currently planned include:

- Advanced representations in transformer architectures
- Cognitive models of bounded rationality
- Geopolitical risk modeling and game-theoretic frameworks

### Selected Topics

Some of the topics I have written on throughout my PhD are:

- Content-driven social networks
- Valuative judgment
- Mechanistic explanation
- Mental illness, psychiatry, therapy

I also have a reasonably extensive background in Indo-European languages and classical philology and philosophy, which shaped my approach to philosophy and to life in ways that a first love might.
