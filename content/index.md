## Hello, I'm Louis

I'm a lot of things, but one of the things that I am is a PhD candidate in philosophy. This digital garden is meant for anyone interested in computation, complex systems, and philosophy. You can browse recent notes or explore by topic. Notes here are often exploratory, reflecting ongoing research or preliminary thoughts, while longer form nonacademic writing on related topics will be available on my [main site](https://louissantoro.com). I plan to publish notes as I study to provide myself and anyone interested with an archive of the topics I cover along the way.
### Background

I began my academic career in classical philology. Within philosophy I originally studied Greek and Roman philosophy, especially Plato. I decided to accept the admissions offer of a PhD in order to take the opportunity to study artificial intelligence, brains, and cognitive science, more generally. Acquiring these skills was challenging as a philosopher, but I now have decent competency in those areas and do research wholly oriented towards computational and theoretical approaches to understanding complex phenomena.

### Research Methodologies

I primarily use computational methods, mostly Python-based analytical and learning frameworks, in order to study and solve problems over [[Complexity/philosophy_of_complexity|complex systems]]. Occasionally, I explore methods that bypass explicit network structures for simpler analytical solutions.

### Future Explorations

Topics and notes currently planned include:
- Advanced representations in transformer architectures
- Cognitive models of bounded rationality
- Geopolitical risk modeling and game-theoretic frameworks

### Selected Topics

Some of the topics I have written on throughout my PhD are:
- Content-driven social networks
- Valuative judgment
- Mechanistic explanation
- Mental illness, psychiatry, therapy

I also have a reasonably extensive background in Indo-European languages and classical philology and philosophy, which shaped my approach to philosophy and to life in ways that a first love might.
