## Hello, I'm Louis

I'm a lot of things, but one of the things that I am is a PhD candidate in philosophy. This digital garden serves as a repository for my learning in computation, complex systems, and philosophy. The site is designed to be fast, text-focused, distraction free, and easy to read. Notes can be searched, browsed by recency, or explored by topic. The writing here is often a memento of a topic, an exploratory thoughts, or reflect fragments of ongoing research, while longer form nonacademic writing on related topics will be available on my [main site](https://louissantoro.com). I will always strive for accuracy in producing these notes, but be sure to consult the primary works. I plan to publish notes as I study to provide myself and anyone interested a permanently accessible archive of the topics I cover along the way.

### Background

I began my academic career in classical philology with a view to reading the Greek philosophers. I eventually made my way to philosophy where I originally studied Greek and Roman philosophy, especially Plato. I decided to accept the admissions offer of a PhD in philosophy in order to take a different tack, namely, to use the opportunity to study artificial intelligence, brains, and cognitive science, more generally. Acquiring these skills was challenging as a philosopher, but I now have decent competency in those areas and do research wholly oriented towards computational and theoretical approaches to understanding complex phenomena.

## Why publish these

I took a long retreat from any online presence and any attempt to publish any work publicly for about 7 years. I noticed that academic publishing encourages a philosopher to write work that isn't very important and that the odds of producing something genuinely valuable on one's own, something *aere perennius*, were almost zero in the first place. I have reasonably extensive notes in other forms, but some of the books that I read or things that occurred to me during that time are probably forever lost. Some of the topics I covered in my early intellectual career I may never cover again. This archive will at least capture what happens from here. 

I fancy myself a creative intellectual. Anyone with any creativity at all has an inexhaustible treasury of ideas, issue by fiat in the shower or on a walk to the store. Anything I share here is free, without the expectation of payment. But, as a matter of principle, I always attempt to provide others the courtesy of acknowledging my indebtedness to their ideas and to respect their rights by attributing ideas that are not my own. I don't like intellectual theft; I also don't like the idea of clamping down, charging money, making a corny site, etc. If you see any value in the way that I approach these questions, I would be grateful if you did not begrudge me the satisfaction of knowing that my writing made some difference for you. Credit my work where appropriate, and let's be friends rather than lifelong, bitter enemies.

### Research Methodologies

I primarily use computational methods in order to study and solve problems over [[Complexity/philosophy_of_complexity|complex systems]]. Though 'complex systems' often denotes a network approach, I explore methods that bypass explicit network structures if doing so is useful.

### Future Explorations

Topics and notes currently planned include:
- Advanced representations in transformer architectures
- Cognitive models of bounded rationality
- Geopolitical risk modeling and game-theoretic frameworks

### Selected Topics

Some of the topics I have written on throughout my PhD are:
- Content-driven social networks
- Valuative judgment
- Mechanistic explanation
- Mental illness, psychiatry, therapy

I also have a reasonably extensive background in Indo-European languages and classical philology and philosophy, which shaped my approach to philosophy and to life in ways that a first love might.

 The site is built using the awesome, open source , so check that out, too!
