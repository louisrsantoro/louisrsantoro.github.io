Hello, I'm Louis. I'm a lot of things, but one of the things that I am is a PhD candidate in philosophy.

I will be using the space to share my notes on various topics. My interests are pretty eclectic, but I would lump them together using the term 'complex systems'. In *Theory of complex systems*, Thurner, Hanel, Klimek define a complex system as a co-evolving multilayer network:

$$
M_{ij}^\alpha(t)
$$

J.L. Austin famously said, Oversimplification is the disease of philosophy. But if philosophers engage with complex systems the disease need not be terminal.

Some of the recent topics I have studied are content-driven social networks, valuative judgment, mental illness.
