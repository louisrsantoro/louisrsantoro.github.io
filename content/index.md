## Hello, I'm Louis

Thank you for visiting my website! I'm a lot of things, but one of the things that I am is a PhD candidate in Philosophy. This digital garden serves as a repository for my learning in computation, complex systems, and philosophy. The site is designed to be fast, text-focused, distraction free, and easy to read. Notes can be searched, browsed by recency, or explored by topic. The writing here is often a memento of a topic, an exploratory thoughts, or reflect fragments of ongoing research, while longer form nonacademic writing on related topics will be available on my [main site](https://louissantoro.com). I will always strive for accuracy in producing these notes, but be sure to consult the primary works. I plan to publish notes as I study to provide myself and anyone interested a permanently accessible archive of the topics I cover along the way.

### Background

I began my academic career in classical philology with a view to reading the Greek philosophers. I eventually made my way to philosophy where I studied Greek and Roman philosophy, especially Plato. I decided to accept the admissions offer of a PhD in Philosophy in order to take a different tack, namely, to use the opportunity to study artificial intelligence, brains, and cognitive science, more generally. Acquiring these skills was challenging as a philosopher, but I now have decent competency in those areas and do research wholly oriented towards computational and theoretical approaches to understanding complex phenomena. Along the way I developed an interest in computational social science as well.

### Why publish these notes

I took a long retreat from any online presence and any attempt to publish any work publicly for about 7 years starting in 2020. I noticed that academic publishing encourages a philosopher to write work that simply isn't important and that the odds of producing something genuinely valuable on one's own, something *aere perennius*, were almost zero in the first place. Publishing is not very difficult. I thought that perhaps I should study enough that I can think and say something worth communicating. I have reasonably extensive notes in other forms, but some of the books that I read or things that occurred to me during that time are probably forever lost. Some of the topics I covered in my early intellectual career I may never cover again. This archive is intended to capture what happens from here.

### A request

I fancy myself a creative intellectual. Anyone with any real creativity has an inexhaustible treasury of ideas, issued by fiat in the shower or on a walk to the store. It's actually overwhelming to have so many good ideas. Anything I share here is free, without the expectation of payment. But, as a matter of principle, I always attempt to provide others the courtesy of acknowledging my indebtedness to their ideas, to respect their rights by attributing ideas that are not my own. I don't like intellectual theft; I also don't like the idea of clamping down, charging money, making an ugly website, etc. If you see any value in the way that I approach these questions, I would be grateful if you did not begrudge me the satisfaction of knowing that my writing made some difference for you. Credit my work where appropriate, even just find a way to say thank you. That way you can make a friend rather than a bitter, lifelong enemy.

### Research Methodologies

My research largely uses computational methods in order to study and solve problems over [[Complexity/philosophy_of_complexity|complex systems]]. Though 'complex systems' often denotes a network approach, I explore methods that bypass explicit network structures if doing so is useful. Each of the last three years has been oriented toward a different project. In order of most recent to least: a paper modeling influence maximization in content-driven social networks, a paper on a decision theoretic approach to valuative takings, and a paper arguing for a bottom up, network approach to schizophrenia.

### Future Explorations

Recently, I have become interested:

- Advanced representations in transformer architectures
- Biology-based learning architectures in investigable organisms
- Geopolitical and geoeconomic modeling.

### Closing Out

Thanks again for visiting my site! This site was built using a customized implementation of [[https://quartz.jzhao.xyz/||Quartz 4]], whose existence greatly sped up development of the site. All the modifications I made can be found in the GitHub repository for the project. If you have any questions or want to connect, please do! I can be reached at [[dikaiosvne@gmail.com||dikaiosvne@gmail.com]] or you can go follow me using the social links I included in the page's header.
