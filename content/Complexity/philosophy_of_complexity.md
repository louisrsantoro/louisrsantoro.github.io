title: A Note on the Philosophy of Complexity
---
I would lump my eclectic interests together under the term 'complex systems'. J.L. Austin famously said, "[O]ver-simplification is the occupational disease of philosophers." This tongue-in-cheek comment points out a profound truth that all those trained in academic philosophy understand. Austin's full comment that over-simplification is actually the profession as such is characteristically funny, but as a philosopher trained in the Greeks, it seemed to me an acknowledgment that academic philosophy had abandoned the Aristotelian charge of striving to know anything at all, oddly so often in the name of Aristotelianism itself. The important question is not always what Aristotle, Kant, or whoever *actually wrote* but rather what they *would have written.* 

More so than ever, philosophy can be a discipline that still attracts great intellects, but it won't do so by believing with the later Wittgenstein that philosophy reduces to a set of linguistic problems. On my view, then, oversimplification is generally the rejection of the charge to elevate the level of our thought to the complexity of the phenomena rather than to compress or reduce the phenomena to terms convenient to our models and thought. This is not a new thought to anyone in philosophy, only a brief statement of how I believe that by incorporating computational, quantitative, scientific tools with conceptual analysis, philosophy can reclaim some of its position as the *prima philosophia*. Some measure of simplification is unavoidable, but in general I seek to push computational or other models out toward the edge of what can be represented at all.

In **Introduction to the Theory of Complex Systems**, Thurner, Hanel, and Klimek define a complex system as a coevolving multilayer network of interacting entities, where interaction strength is denoted by:

$$
M_{ij}^\alpha(t)
$$

where $i,j$ are entities, and $\alpha$ is their relationship. Although this powerful form of representation is oftentimes scientifically valuable, the purpose of denoting 'complex systems' as the object of study is not a methodological commitment to graphs now and forever but a metaphysical characterization of the kinds of entities and processes that interest me philosophically.
